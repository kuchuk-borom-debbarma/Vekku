**Phase:** Refining

## Context
Our "Brain" was getting smarter, but it had a reading comprehension problem. When we fed it a complex thought—like a run-on sentence jumping from coding to gardening—it treated the whole blob as one idea. This meant that searching for "Roses" might accidentally pull up "Compiler Errors" just because they were in the same sentence.

We needed a way to surgically separate these ideas correctly.

## Decisions
We explored three paths:
1.  **Regex Hacking**: My initial attempt. I tried to inject periods before connector words ("but", "and"). It worked for the specific test case but felt dirty and fragile.
2.  **Semantic Chunking**: The "Premium" way using embedding similarity. We implemented a custom logic for this, but ultimately found it introduced complexity and latency that might be overkill for our current stage.
3.  **LangChain Recursive Splitter**: The "Standard" way.

**We chose Option 3 (Recursive Splitter)**.
Use `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` but configured with *semantic separators* (e.g., `" but "`, `" and "`). This gives us 80% of the "semantic" benefit (splitting run-on sentences) with 100% of the stability and speed of a rule-based system.

## Implementation
-   **Node.js Service**: Refactored `BrainLogic` to use `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.
-   **Configuration**: Centralized all hardcoded strings.
-   **Stability**: Removed the experimental semantic splitting logic to prioritize a robust, standard foundation.

## Next Steps
Now that the Brain can read and separate ideas clearly, sticking them into the database (the **Knowledge Graph**) is the next frontier. We need to ensure that these "Semantic Regions" are linked not just to tags, but to each other.
