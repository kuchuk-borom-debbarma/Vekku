**Phase:** Architecture & Definition

## 1. Feature Selection: The Ontology Manager
I have decided to begin development with **Micro-Feature #1: User Tags & Hierarchy**.

While the AI capabilities are exciting, I realized that the system needs a "skeleton" before it can have a "brain." The AI needs a structure to suggest against. Therefore, I will focus first on building the **Ontology Manager**, which allows me to:
1.  Manually create tags.
2.  Define strict parent-child relationships (e.g., "Java is a child of Backend").
3.  Visualize this hierarchy.

This ensures that when I eventually turn on the AI, it acts as a smart assistant respecting my defined structure, rather than just generating random keywords.

## 2. Service Architecture Definition
To keep the code clean and maintainable, I have defined a "Separation of Concerns" architecture consisting of three distinct services:

### A. `TagService` (The Structure)
* **Role:** The Librarian.
* **Responsibility:** It handles the strict logic of the Graph Database (Neo4j). It manages tag creation and the hierarchy. It knows nothing about vectors or AI.

### B. `BrainService` (The Intelligence)
* **Role:** The Analyst.
* **Responsibility:** It handles the fuzzy logic of the Vector Database (Qdrant). It deals with text embedding, similarity search, and finding matches. It knows nothing about the graph structure.

### C. `IngestionService` (The Orchestrator)
* **Role:** The Project Manager.
* **Responsibility:** It connects the other two. It takes a file, asks the `BrainService` to understand it, and asks the `TagService` to organize it, ensuring both databases stay in sync.
