# Vekku

## Intelligent Unified Content Store

**Vekku** is an intelligent, unified content store designed to organize all your digital knowledge. Unlike traditional document management systems, Vekku is built to ingest and understand a wide variety of text-based content—from simple Markdown notes and formal documents to live URLs.

It combines strict organization consistent with your personal workflow and adaptive AI that understands the meaning of your content, not just keywords.

## Key Features

### Smart Organization
Vekku automatically organizes your content using a powerful tagging system that learns from you. It supports strict hierarchies (e.g., "Contracts" is under "Legal") and flexible associations, ensuring you can always find what you need.

### Universal Import
Bring all your text into one place. Vekku currently supports:
*   **Documents:** PDF, Text files.
*   **Markdown:** Notes and documentation.
*   **URLs:** Intelligent web scraping to capture online content.
*   *Coming Soon:* Adapters for even more content sources.

### Intelligent Suggestions
Vekku works with you, suggesting tags and organization based on three layers of intelligence:
1.  **Content Meaning:** It reads and understands the topics discussed in your text.
2.  **Your Habits:** It learns from your history to predict how you like to file things.
3.  **Your Rules:** It respects your defined hierarchies, automatically applying related tags.

### Adaptive Learning
Vekku gets smarter as you use it. It detects when topics change within a single document—separating a "Legal Disclaimer" from a "Technical Manual"—and learns to distinguish the nuances of your specific tags over time.

## Future Roadmap

### Unified Semantic Search
Find exactly what you're looking for, even if you don't remember the exact keywords. Ask questions like "Find the invoice for server costs" or "Show me all research notes about AI."

### Continuous Improvement
Vekku runs quietly in the background, constantly refining its understanding of your content and tags to provide ever-more accurate suggestions and search results.
